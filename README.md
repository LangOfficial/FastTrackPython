This is the Github repository for my book Fast Track Python. It has multiple folders in the main branch corresponding to the multiple chapters, containing exercises and projects. 
I hope the exercises answers help.
If you have any questions on an exercise, answer, projects, or anything about the book, email me at langleytieu@gmail.com
